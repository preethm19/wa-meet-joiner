# WhatsApp-Google Meet Auto-Joiner

**In the chaos of college life, online class links drop into your WhatsApp group at unpredictable moments—mid-lunch, during a quick walk, or while you're away from your keyboard. Missing the notification means scrambling to join late, fumbling through tabs, and awkwardly clicking "Ask to join" while the lecture rolls on. With the WhatsApp Meet Auto-Joiner, that's history: the bot silently watches the group, spots the Meet code instantly, opens a new tab in your existing Chrome, and auto-clicks the blue "Ask to join" button. You're in the meeting before the professor even notices, ready to focus without the rush.**
